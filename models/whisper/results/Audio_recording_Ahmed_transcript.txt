 So usually you get your instrument in first and then you follow it with endoscope. And after that, if the mucosa is well prepped, usually we use a mixture of cocaine and adrenaline. So if I follow my instruments here, what do we see here in the inferior bit? So if you describe what you're seeing as if I've not seen it before. So usually here you find phosphatrose and molar and zequena down. And if you even go more inside, you should be able to see the stachan tube on the right and the left hand side. Maybe if you have a 30 degrees you would be able to do that. But this is zequena. It's very important to identify it at the beginning because this is one of the landmarks you're going to use. And if that's so, this would be the inferior turbinate. So this is going to be the inferior turbinate here. And this is going to be the middle turbinate, which is around here. And usually the sphenoid ostium is what you are looking for, which is about half an inch, like 2 cm, just above the zequena. So then what you do next is you try to lateralise the middle turbinate and pay attention not to break it. So just squeeze it to the other side. You may need some force to do that, which I am using to be honest now. And I think now you can introduce rhindus corpin. And this should be the sphenoid ostium here. And this is the sphenoid ostium. And this is the sphenoid ostium. Yeah, this is the sphenoid ostium. Here is a boas moidalis, which we might have violated. Okay, anyway, I think this is the sphenoid ostium. And now you need to do your rescue flap and get it ready and try to have a binasal, a binasal approach. So if I can have a cutting knife, please. Thank you. Okay. We should have already did lateralise that, but it's coming back now. So try to do it again. No, not feeling it. Okay, can I have the knife again now? Yes. Knife? Yes, please. Thank you. So you introduce your knife. And then you do a cut based on the bone here. You try to do it one up and go down again. So when you go this way, you go down again. So make sure you already strip the mucosa, you can see. And now you begin to see the vomer, or the bony part of the nasal septum, which I am on right now. Okay, and now you try to do that and then you go to the contralateral side and you should be able to break it. Okay. And then strip it on the lateral side as well. You can see this is not entirely cut here. You see there is still a bit. We might need to use a knife again. Thank you. Okay, this should be raised now. Thank you. Let's continue the mucosal stripping. So we do mucosal stripping. Okay, yes. Now we have access to the contralateral side. And if you put the frees the other way around like that, you will be able to strip. So we stripped from here. And if you are able to place it to the other side of the frees, you can strip it here as well. So I feel bone on both sides. Okay. Okay. And after you do that, you just need to clear things apart. So maybe use a back biter. You get your back biter in. Okay. Yeah, I will try to have some bites from that. Yes. Okay. At that time you should be able to insert a sucker from the other side. This should be a normal. Let's see. Yeah. Can I have a freeze? So again, same steps. I'm trying to rationalize the target. Because you should be able to see the other side from here. Okay. Can I have a ronger maybe? So now I'm just taking this part of the bony section. Okay. Okay. Freeze. Okay. So this is what we have here is. Okay. Okay. Ronger. Just take the squids out. Okay. So what we have here. This is a sphenoid. Okay. Okay. We can see that we can be inside the cellar. Can have a glimpse of what it looks like inside the cellar here. Okay. So the way of doing it is having an up cut. And try to insert it and just, you know, open the sphenoid osteon on that side. It might be quite tight for this up cut. Yeah. What do you suggest we use? So if we can't get the up cut in, it might work to drill it. Drill it completely? Just to create some space for the up cut. Okay. Let's try to see how that goes. It will pass the cavity. It's then just quite tight in the osteon itself. Yeah. The angle is not right. Okay. How about I give it a freeze again? Okay. You may need to use the drill early to clear some space. Yeah, I think I'll be able to do that. I'm just trying to strip them closer so the drill doesn't cut them closer. So I'm going to do that. Might need to use a, what do you call it, a zetter brider. Okay. So can I have the ronger again? Just take this part of the naso septum. Yes. So you're clearing the posterior septum to see the contralateral side? Yes, basically what I'm trying to do, but the mucosa keeps collapsing. Okay. I think I got this large piece which I wanted. I think it's going to be, we have more room inside now. Yeah, I think you got a large septal opening there. Yeah. Okay, so I think it's time to use a zetter brider just to have a better view here. We were through to the other side from here, but we're not entirely through, so let's get a zetter brider. Okay. I'll try to strip this mucosa. And if you just... Let me just zoom in. Touch to change, yeah. Yeah, now I'm the brider. Okay. So you always need to check which side it is facing. And it doesn't have suction attached to it, right? Not at the moment. Okay, yeah. Can we attach suction to it? Or can I... So I can suck for you. No, no, can we attach suction to the brider itself? Just makes the life easier of its function. It may not work well. Okay, let's see. Let's try. No, it's not sucking on it. Okay, let's try it. Let's just try it first. Okay, now it's on your side. Okay. This mucosa is quite tough. You may need a bit more force than you would normally. Okay, this is just using a ronger? Or a back biter? Yeah, it should come with a ronger and a back biter. Okay. Okay, at least we have a hole now. Okay, let's get the back... Let's get the ronger. The ronger. Yep. Okay, I think I should just use the force. I think it's too forceful. Okay. Okay, I think to twist... Try to twist them. You know, it's going to stretch the whole thing out if I do that. Okay. Okay, let's use the force now. Okay. Okay, now we have ostium on both sides. Okay. Which is something nice to see, finally. Okay, but you can see you are limited to work inferiorly because of all that septum. So you need to take it out. Okay. Okay, this part down is a volmer. Okay. Okay, this is what I needed out. So I think we can start drilling now. You... Yeah. I mean, myocosa is almost out. We have a septal flap that's intact here. We might use a debrider just one more time before we start. Because, you know, it keeps twitching, so we just want to make sure that we don't want to use it again. Just cleaning. You know, around here. So you're just making sure you've got good access to the osteo. Exactly, exactly. And... Yes. This is on that side, and this is on that side. Yeah, I think the braille looks good, to be honest. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, can we have the ronger again? The ronger. The ronger. Okay, I think the good thing now is you have access from your side. If you use the side cut. Okay. If you just, you know, use the side cut and try to put it from your side. I think you should have access. Does it need to be screwed? You shouldn't force it. Usually, you know, it drives its own inside. Let's have a look. Let's have a look and see. Yeah, because the serpent is in the way, isn't it? So, again, the squainer. Squainer. Yeah. Okay. That's your way in here. That's your way in here. Okay. So, I can follow your scope and division. Okay. Yeah. Go in here? No, no. This way? Yep. Yes. Yes. Yes. Now, if I go from that side, I should be able to see now. Yeah, and that's my sucker. Yeah, okay. So, that's your sucker now. So, I think we have access from both sides. Something we usually have very handy. Okay, nice. Now, use the drill. So, let me switch. Make sure the organisms are working. Okay, maybe the tricky part. I hope not. Okay, yes. Do you want to wash this one? Yeah. Yeah. You can take the sucker out of this one. Take the sucker out. I'll get you some wash. Yeah. Okay, put your sucker in. Okay, just turn the suction off. I forgot to stop. Can I have something to clean? Okay. Okay. Okay. Just because you're pushing that, please stop. Okay. Okay. Okay. Put some wash in. Yeah. Okay. Can I have the sucker? Yeah, sure. Just starting to check. Where are we? Some wash going in. Okay, so we are almost inside as we know. This is your midline, so you always know where the midline is by always looking into the homework. Yeah, I think it doesn't look so bad. If you can put the suction in, please. Suction, yeah. Okay. Tell me when you're ready. Yeah. So we may have a clash of hands on the suction. Okay. There's something that you do not want to happen, which is me coating your drill. The way of doing it is just always try to be here and push backwards. Okay. Line up. Okay. Do you want some wash in now? Yeah, please. On suction, please. Suction, please. Okay, can you feel my suction, please? Okay. Can I have a run-jaw now? Run-jaw, yeah. Usually I like to open it with an up-cut and then drill at the end, but the bone here is very tough. I think we can be able to take some bits. So you're opening up the sphenoid osteo across the midline? Yeah. This is part of the anterior sphenoidotomy we're doing right now. We're connecting the two osteons together. And then it's always nice to have a look inside the scala, make sure you are in the right place. Is that semi-cold, sir? Yeah. I mean, I haven't looked at the scan pre-operatively, but I think this is a... Usually there is a sphenoid, multiple compartments and septum. Rarely they lead to the midline, rarely. It is a very important note. Most of the times they lead to one of the carotid pillars. And then they lead to the midline. And then they lead to the midline. And then they lead to the midline. And then they lead to the midline. And then they lead to the midline. Most of the times they lead to one of the carotid pillars, which will be on either side. So now you are just stripping out the... Stripping the mucosa. ...mucosa. And this system is usually bleeding. So, you should be having always either a suction pipe roller or some sponges or some surgical already. And can we watch inside? Yeah. Okay, I just clean my scalp. Okay. I am using my psychiatric strip. Okay. I think we might need still to drill here. Down to the vomer. So we have more imperial access. Drill again and suction in, please. Okay. Yes, thank you. Suction in, please. So, you want to go with your hand? That's fine, you can suck on the nostril opening and it will suck the smoke out. Which is all what we need at the moment. Okay. Can I have a wash? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Okay. So, I need to strip the mucosa more now. And around here? Yeah. This part of the end is sphenoid septum. Okay. Nice. Mucosa is clearing nicely. Yeah, it's clearing now. Yeah. Yeah, I think we need to drill now. Do we have an upcut facing down? We've got the three. Yeah. Again, completing the anterior sphenodotomy backwards, so we have more vision of the anterior edge. You always want to see the cliva resus very nicely, and you won't be able to do that until you have a very nice visualization of the bomer. Yeah, which I think we will in a minute. Yeah, longer now. I think this should be enough. Okay. Sorry. It's okay. So, always study your... Can we turn this section off? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. So, always study your septum before going in, because you can try to pull on a septum and think that it looks alright, but it actually leads to a cortipillar, which we will be able to see in a minute now. Okay. Do you have a smaller orange here? Yeah. Okay. Alright. Okay. Okay. So, what do we have here? This is the sala. Yeah. You've exposed the anatomy. Yeah. So, anatomy-wise, usually here's... This is a carotid pillar. This is a carotid pillar on the right-hand side, and this is one on the left-hand side. Here looks like what is OCR, which what leads you, the optical carotid resus. What does this thing lead you to? So, you can follow to the chiasm. This is what leads you to the clinoid. Yeah. Okay. So, this is what leads you to... If you're doing clinoidectomies, this is what you see. And this looks like here. You know, this looks like optics on both sides. Yeah. So, one on that side and one on the other side. Carotid pillar on the contralateral side. Resus. We haven't had enough exposure. Yes. So, this is a clival resus. Can you see? If you're unable to manipulate here down... So, removing the pituitary, you remove the lower pituitary first... Yeah. ...before going into other sides. And if you want to do that, you're going to have a very nice and clear exposure and access. So, we need to drill that septum in. Okay. Let's use the drill again. There's the septum down. And then after we are happy with our exposure, what we're going to do... Okay, let me take this piece of bone out. Yeah. After we're happy with cellular exposure, what we're going to do... So, you're going to get yourself happy with the exposure, you'll identify the anatomy... Yeah. ...and then you'll start opening the cellar. Exactly. We're doing Xabocereus fin and artery. Drill number three. Two. Okay. Do you want some suction? Yeah, put the suction on the muscle. I forget to... So, here you are drilling the septum to improve your view. Yeah, drilling the septum down to the floor. Okay. Okay, and now you want to clear that... Sorry. Now you want to clear the septum. Okay. Okay, and I think now you'll appreciate that if we have not done enough drilling here, here at the boomer... Yeah. ...you'll be able to reach down here, okay? Because something will be holding your instrument, which I still have, by the way, but I think I can get away with it. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's a nice view. That's the rhesus. I can feel the rhesus here. So, now we can start drilling our cellar. Okay. Can you put some more sand in? Yeah. So, we have a better view. Okay. Is it clear? I think the section might be blocked. Okay. I'm just going to try here. Okay. Okay. So, let's see. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Well done. Okay. Let's drill inside now. Can you put the suction on? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Can I have a suction to see what's happening inside? Yeah. Maybe if you'd like some wash. Yeah. Please. Would you help me? Let me just put my suction in first. Yep. Okay. Yeah. Wash. Yeah. We're almost in. So it looks like we have the suction pump on. So let's see. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. I can tell it looks very thin. Yeah. It's usually thin if you have a tumor in. And sometimes you even may be able to flick it. If you get your instrument in the right side. Let me just try to see it. Yep. I think we might have got what we were looking for. Yep. Okay. Is it dura? Yeah. So I think you're through to dura there. Yeah. So can I have an up cut? Usually you need one or two up cuts in here. And you might be able to complete your exposure. Yeah. It's a large up cut. So you're working around where are your lateral boundaries for your cellulose? Yeah. And when you have bleeding, that's when you stop because this bleeding is coming from calvinism. So you don't have a lot of bleeding from the intercavernous sinus. The good thing about that is that when you have a tumor, I mean, is that when you have a tumor, usually the tumor blocks the intercavernous connection. So the cell is expanded by the tumor and the intercavernous connection is blocked. So you don't have a lot of bleeding from the intercavernous sinus. And the bad thing about it is that after you take the tumor out, you start to have the bleeding. Okay. Now you need to make sure that you have good boundaries. Down and up and up and down. And you know when you are completely flush with the floor. So if I have a disector, do you have a disector? That's fine. I can use a Frius if you don't. It's probably best with the Frius. I've got a Cure-Vet. That's all right. Cure-Vet. Both. So if you try to feel here down, usually this is a floor. So I think we are almost seen. So now we open the dura. Okay. And to open the dura, we open it in a criss-cross fashion, second life phase. And we try to open from up down. So you open like that. Okay. And I think dura is quite thick. Yeah, I think. Yes? Yeah. But it's opening. Okay. Yeah. I didn't hope to open it like that, but I hope to do a good criss-cross. Okay. Let's see what we have now. That's right. Okay. And then you are inside. So I think there may be tumour there. It looks a little tumour-y. Okay. So can we have a curette? You start walking down first. Yeah, it is a tumour. And if you have a ranger, you can grab these pieces of tumour. Mr. Thomas likes to do an extra capsule dissection, which is something very, very handy if you know how to do it. It's basically trying to dissect the tumour without breaching the capsule and bringing most of it in one piece. Yeah. So we send this for a specimen, and you try to work your boundaries down first. And once you're happy with the inferior edge of the tumour, you work yourself on the sides and then you go up. And why you go up at the end? So you go up because it usually raises the diaphragm. Exactly. So you want to come. Exactly. So inferior CSF leak. So even if you have it, you have it at the end of the tumour. So you're happy with your section. Usually you want to see the diaphragm come down. Yeah. Okay. Very nice. More tumour coming out. So now I'm working on the... Once you're happy with the specimen, you can suck it out. Yeah. So we'll get the sucker in. Might be struggling. Yeah. Yeah, I think we're going to struggle with suction strength. Nice. Nice. Nice. Let me just try to dissect that before going into the cellar. Because usually you don't like to go inside the cellar with the sucker. Absolutely. Now I think, yeah, you can see down. Yeah. Down is clear now. So we walk our way on the sides. And tumour delivers itself very nicely. I'm very happy with this tumour. I wish all my tumours are like that. Nice and soft. Yeah. Yeah, it just breaks down. Do you want to go around a bit? You can see it's very soft. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. It's very soft, but the suction is quite weak. OK. So yeah, you may need to... OK, we'll chase it down. We'll chase it later on. Laundry room? No, no, the purity room. Very nice. Yeah, I think now we can see... We start to see normal. Yeah. Yeah, it's the last piece here, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. These curts are really nice. Yeah, laundry room? Small or large laundry room? No, big one, because the small one just breaks it into pieces. OK. OK. OK, do you have a 90 degree scale? I believe we do. Yeah, usually this is what you do, you know, at the end. Oh, what is this one? Big one. Yes, exactly. Let me see who's clearing out laterally. OK. Yeah. Laundry. Laundry, yeah, laundry room. OK, I have the diaphragma here. Control 2. Control 2. Yeah, it's all cleared now. Very nice. Yeah. Little scraps left, but not much. Yeah. OK, I'm happy with the section. Great. Let's go the way off. You're happy? Yeah. So, 3, 2, 1, finished.
