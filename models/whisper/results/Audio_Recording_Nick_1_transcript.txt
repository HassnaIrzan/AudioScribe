 Thanks. All right. So we'll look up the right nares. And we can see the inferior turbinate there. We can see the middle turbinate there. We come along the floor of the nares. And we see the eustachian tube and the recess of Rosenm√ºller on the back of the pharynx. Always check that just to make sure there are no obvious abnormalities, cancers, polyps on our way. There's our inferior turbinate. Here's our middle turbinate. We put our dissector all the way to the back. And you can see the superior turbinate there. And you will see the sphenoid ostium, which is essentially at the base of the superior turbinate. And there it is. And that identifies the entry point into the sphenoid ostium. And we try and break this back so that we can increase the access into the sphenoid sinus. And that is where we're going to be making an incision with our knife to dissect away the cartilaginous septum from the bony septum. But in actual fact, if you just break it very gently with your dissector, you can fracture in the right place. There is our bony septum. And then we can cut this mucosa along here with a knife. So if you've got the knife there, Matt, we will find that. Thank you. So if you can't work out where your instrument is, bring your scope back a little bit. And then cut along to the sphenoid ostium. It says phenopalatine branches. The posterior septal artery is below us. And we'll maintain the blood supply for Hadad-Bazogastogai flap should it be required. Take that back. And we'll take that again. And see if we can break this across. And what we want to then do is see the sphenoid ostium on the contralateral side. If we can. There's our what's known as a rescue flap, the inferior to the sphenoid ostium within the mucosa. Dissect this down. Ponsar. And then come across the opposite side. And identify the sphenoid ostium on the opposite side. Submucosal. So there we are. Yeah, just about coming into view there. Two sphenoid ostia there. And the vomer. The upturned ship hull. A pair of rangers, please. Big rangers. Petite rangers. Thank you. So with impunity now, we can actually bite this bit. And that can be taken away. If you ever bite a bit of mucosa and you catch it, bite it and then take it in rather than pulling it straight out. Because that way you can avoid the mucosa just landing on the end of your scope. And sometimes this bone is thick and won't come away, which appears to be the case here. In which case we may end up doing a bit of drilling. Let's get a kerosene in the first instance, please. We've got a kerosene there. Thank you. So we're just enlarging the sphenoid ostium here. Thank you. Oops. That's just fallen apart. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We've got a 2 kerosene there, mate. Let's see what we've got. Thank you. So we've got a down-biting kerosene now. Is it on there? Is it... Yeah, this is set down. Thank you. Thank you. So as we open up the sphenoid ostium, we should be able to break across the roma. And then the 2 kerosene back, the... Pinching up. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, there you go, kerosene, then. Thanks. That one's broken. Is that what it is? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So bite the mucosa and take it in before pulling it out. And then the mucosa won't... Catch on the end of your scope. Right, let's try the debrider, then. Thank you. Can I have the suction on, please? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Right, so the back biter, please, Matt. Cheers. Cheers. Right. And the pituitary rongeurs, please. Thanks. And cup. Thank you. This is debrider. Right. Right. Right. Right, pituitary rongeurs, please. And cup. Right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Septal mucosa seems to be disarticulated there a bit. Uh-huh. Cannot see a thing, then. Right. Okay. Suction, please. Thank you. Right. Right, rongeurs, please. Thank you. Okay. I'll take that. Mm, okay. It behaves slightly as a... Hm? It behaves slightly as more of a... Yeah. ...pituitary. Okay. And cup. Oh, my God. Kerosene three, please. Thank you. Rongeurs, please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Freezers. And it's all going up. Uh-huh. Rongeurs, big rongeurs, please, again. So, just a little bit more of this... ...septum here, so that we can... ...see what we're doing. All right. Let's try the drill. Thank you. If you could put a sucker down that... ...nares there, just a little suction would do. Your nares, yeah. Thank you. Good. Bit of irrigation. All right. All right. Some middle iron. Good. Good. Bit of irrigation down that side. And a sucker, please, mate. Thank you. Okay. Good. Drill back again, please. Thank you. Thank you. Cute, cute rongeurs. Good. Oh, well. Thank you. Big irrigation down there. Let's see what we've got. Grab that, thanks. Good. Good. Good. Kerosene three, please. Thank you. Point them in. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Cute rongeurs, please. Thank you. Okay. Good. Kerosene three, please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So there's our midline. Yeah. Rongeurs, please. Yeah. Thank you. All right. So. If you're ever not quite sure where you are, always head south. Expose the... ...sphenoid sinus floor. So we need to do that. Come down here. Can't quite see where I am at the moment. All right. Irrigation, thanks. Ah, thank you. Big rongeurs, please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. No. No. Just a bit of trail there again. Thank you. All right. A little bit of irrigation, please. Just going to unbolt the sucker. Thank you. All right. All right. Rongeurs, please. Thank you. Grand. Grand. So there's our floor. Yep. Just around the corner, it's back. We've still got a bit more... ...of the very much to take. But there's our potato potter. Yep. Now, we'll take a little bit more there. First of all with this. And then we'll come around here. And then we'll seal all our relevant anatomy. There we are. There we are. All right. Big irrigation, please. Thank you. Grand. So we'll go there. Let's try that biggest sucker for a second. Thank you. A bit more irrigation, please. Thank you. Thank you. Yep. There we are. Thanks. Rongeurs, potato rongeurs. Thank you. Thanks. Grand. There we are. Suction, please. Thanks very much. I'll take the smallest sucker in a second. OK. Lovely, let's have the children. Thank you. Carotid, carotid. Got the floor down there. Thank you. Not at all. OK. A bit of irrigation down there. Thank you. Suction, thanks. There we are. Drilling a bit over the carotid there. Mm-hmm. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. Yep, big irrigation, thanks. Carotid down there. OK. OK. Thank you. Big wash, yeah. Wash, yeah. OK. Great, yeah. Massive wash there, that. Just check the big one down there, go on. That's lovely. Good. See that? There's a lot to clear out there. There is. There we are. There we are, that's all good. Fill in the codes there. Brand. Back to you. Yep. Thank you, so. OK. OK. Irrigation there, that. OK. Good, irrigation there. Only got two, so let's see if we can get this one too. Thank you. Downbrushing one, if you've got it there, Matt. Downbrushing Kirsten. Thanks. There you go, downbrushing one. Yeah. Yeah. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. So, brand, thank you, yep. Thanks. OK. OK. So, the trill again? OK. OK. OK. Thanks. OK. Thanks. Thanks. OK. Let's try it. Thank you. I'll take that. On the floor. Thanks. Kerosene, big one. Thanks. Thanks. There we are. The hole in it stopped there. It stopped at the edge there. OK. Alright, so... Big irrigation again, please. Check all that down. Yeah, check all that. Grab a sucker. And then we'll have the second row, please. OK. Thank you. Phew. Alright. It's quite thick. Urgh! Crucial incision's not quite working as one would like. Do we have scissors? Should we use Chinese? Yes, I think we do. So... Don't worry, let's just use those instead. I was going to use a dissector. Oh. Won't really cruciate. Incision made. Oh well. Let's try the knife again. It'll be nice to... See if we can achieve that. No, I don't think we can. Alright, so... There's a bit of team up. OK. And cut. So... Cover the sinus wall there. Floor. Cover the sinus wall. OK. Alright. Tumour removed. Right. All done.
