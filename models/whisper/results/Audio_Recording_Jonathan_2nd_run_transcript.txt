 Okay, so you want to have a look at the coena first of all. So inferior turbinate, middle turbinate. And then you can see the sphenoid ostium ahead. There is obviously a mucosa here on this one. So we'll do a rescue flap first of all, so inside knife please. No, not that one, the blade. No, that's it. So you do a rescue flap so you can preserve the sphenopalatine. It's heptoprimesphalosphenopalatine, actually. It's not ideal, this scalpel. Doesn't quite fit. Do a turbinectomy for me, please. What's that? Do a turbinectomy for me, please. No, right. Careful of that. So, see if this works. So then you... Try and enjoy this audio when you move the blade. Yeah, so this is now creating a rescue flap. So, maintaining or preserving the septal bronchus, sphenopalatine artery. Right. Upcut, please. Open up the sphenoid ostea. Good. Could do with being a smaller upcut. Let's just try this. Okay. Preserve them. Trying to preserve the mucosa on the contralateral side by typically you fracture it and go through. It's quite stiff and hard. So I'll try the upcut again. Good. Target in. Good. Okay, try a blank sleeve. Good. Good. It's really hard. Good. Good. We're going to struggle to do this without a smaller upcut. Yeah. Unless we try and drill. Should we try again? Or do you think the plastic will just melt? We'll see if it's starting to melt. Does it feel the same as the last one? I didn't say the drill was fine on the display, but the model is no longer effective. Should we try? Yeah. Good. Wash please. Okay. Please feel. Good. It seems better, doesn't it? Yeah. Do you want to just hold? Okay. Can you suck it to me, please? Good. It's locked. We've got to think. Yeah. Yeah, it's probably some... Yeah, it's a big one. You've got a stilette? Yeah, it's a bit of a mess. We've got another one. There you go. Okay. It's very clogged up. Yeah. It's down in front. It should be fine. Okay. Okay. Right. Let's try opening it up and see. Okay, again now. Now the hole's bigger. There's water in it now, so every time you go in... Okay. It's really thick, the mucus. Right, back biter, please. It's here. Over. Okay. It's really tough, very different. Okay. Okay. Let's try it again. Yes. We need this sucker, don't we? Yeah. It's a bit... Okay. I'm going to try and see... Open that up and see if we can see the contralateral ostea. Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's have you go in. Okay. Okay. Nice. Okay. So now opening up an anterior sphenoidotomy. Right. So taking out the anterior wall of the sphenoid. Okay. It's very transition to sphenoid phase. Mm-hmm. Yeah, so we're... Let's see if the mucosa comes away now with this. And then you can go in on the other side. Okay. Do you want it on? Yeah, it'll be helpful to... Okay. So the side. Right. Okay. I think the only real way to do this is with a drill. So... Bit of wash, please. Okay. And then suck. Okay. Mm-hmm. So this is sphenoid mucosa now, which is... Yeah. Okay. So let's see... Yeah. Okay. So I need to clean the scope. Yeah. Okay. Try and take the mucosa off. Sphenoid mucosa. Mm-hmm. I think I'm just going... Mm-hmm. ...to go back to make a bit more space than a posterior septectomy. Mm-hmm. And now... I wonder if you can come down the other nostril. No. That's fine. Okay. Yeah, do you want to just hold that there? And I'll take that aspect of the septum out of the way. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'd say I don't think this is nearly as good as a cadaver. As a what, sorry? A cadaver. Yeah. You okay? Yeah. I'm just going... So I think we need to drill more and take out the septal mucosa. Yeah. Not septal, the sphenoid mucosa. Okay. Yes. Okay. If you want to suck, I'm going to drill this down a bit. You might need a bit of wash. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. More wash. Mm-hmm. The septum's blocked. Yeah. That's fine. Okay. Mm-hmm. We're going to struggle to do all of these in the time frame. Mm-hmm. Okay. Could you do your own job, please? Try a blank slate. Try a blank slate first. Mm-hmm. It's really tough, mucosa. Mm-hmm. Chronic sinusitis. What's that say? Chronic sinusitis. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Do they say you can use the debrider? Yeah. Should we try it? Yes. Huh? Yes, I think when it's this thick. Okay. And please, Aaron. Okay. Show him the set. Okay. Okay. Do you want to pass? Okay. Is it in the 1.1? What, sir? When you're putting it, it goes to 200 rpm, which for me is the rpm for the microdebrider. No, it's 1500, sir. Is it? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. There you go. Okay. And then, just be careful of the drape. Yeah. Yep, good. Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's see. Mm-hmm. Do you think it's doing anything? No, it's definitely chunking it up. Yeah. Yeah, it's not sucking it up well. The suction isn't working. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely doing something. Very slowly. Yeah. Pardon me? Mm. Okay. I think we need to drill more of this away. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I need a bit of wash and suction, please. Yeah, the suction is connected to the... Yeah, just... ...and suction. No, no, just take the suction off. And... Nice. Mm. Mm. It's working. Mm-hmm. Mm. It's like a difficult approach for a patient. So... A wash, a little wash. And a little... Mm. Mm. Mm. Thank you. It would be impossible to do this without the drill. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Nice. Mm. Mm. Yeah. It should be slightly easier. Mm. Blakeslee, see if that works better. I still think we need to drill more... ...of here. Mm. And suction in as well? Yeah. Mm. Suction? Yeah. Sorry, it's really stiff here, the other side as well. Yeah. Mm. Do you want me to try? So that's the fossa. Yeah. All right, let's see if we can... ...clear that mucosa first. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Do we have another bronchia? Or is it just... ...this one? I'm gonna... ...smaller pituitary. Mm. Yeah. So I think... ...if I create more space I'll be able to get it out. Let me see this. Put one of these... ...upward-facing ones in here. The suction, please? Mm. Mm. I'm gonna refill one more time. What's that? I'm gonna refill all the... Okay. Okay. Okay. So it's phenoid septum. Mm-hm. This mucosa. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Just a little... Do you reckon it's anywhere near two o'clock yet? Probably. I need to mute. Ali? Ali. I also need to mute it. Right. Right. There you are. Now, there's the fossa. Yeah. Yeah. Right, okay. Mm. Right. There you are. What time is it? Two ten. Mm. If there's anyone free in the control room who would be able to go and meet... ...the next participant, that would be very helpful... ...at the main entrance of St Thomas'. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Right. Mm. It's more involved than I was expecting on this model. Mm. Mm. Right. Okay, I'm going to drill the cellar. Mm-hm. Okay, so moving to the cellar phase. Mm. Mm. Right. Okay. So this is where another two-up coat would be helpful. Yeah. Going to chill? Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. This is the most realistic part of the... ...of the model so far. Mm. Mm. Mm. See if that's a... Ha ha! Mm. Now, what I can't tell is whether there's meant to be a dural lining here or not. I think there is. I think laterally to the left, or if the patient's right, you've gone through it. And I think if you sweep that... ...stuff away. But I think if it is there, it's super thin. I think that's it, you see. Yeah, maybe. Okay. In which case I'll take the knife and have a look. Yeah. Mm. I'm not convinced. You think there's meant to be dural? I think that's a dural layer. Yeah, a separate layer. I think that's dural. Okay, the knife isn't cutting the dural. Yeah. Okay. And I'm not convinced it was attached laterally. Okay. And so... ... Shall we try the ring curette? Yeah. That's the little one. Put it down here. See if it... ... I think... ...that's a 90 degree, and you need a 45. I think it's on the trolley, it's there, isn't it? Yeah. Mm. Yeah, that's a separate layer. So... ...we should try and... Let's try... I don't want to ruin the scissors. Informalin. Yeah. And... Yeah, it's because you know if anything happens to this set... Pardon me? You know if anything happens to any of the kit in this set, it will become Mr. Shaky's set. Yeah, exactly. Okay. So there is a layer of... That's the dural layer, yeah. But I'm not convinced it was attached. No. Laterally, probably laterally. Right. There we are. Tumour removed. Yeah. Okay. Three, two, one, stop.
