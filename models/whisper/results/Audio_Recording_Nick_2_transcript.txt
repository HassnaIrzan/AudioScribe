 Please start. Alright. Thank you. Alright. A free as I'm at, thanks. Alright, so... Four nasal pharynx. Extension tube, recess of rosomulla. Inferior turbinate, middle turbinate. Superior turbinate. Sphenoid ostium. Cut along here. To the sphenoid ostium. Gentle with the mucosa. Learned my lesson. You've got a pair of McIndoe scissors there, decent sized scissors. Or the turbinectomy scissors. They're the big ones. Something, yeah, try those. Let me try those. Thank you, something bigger. Let's just see if that works. Just want to really get something that just cuts properly. Now, all the way back. That might be a good manoeuvre in comparison to last time. That might be a good manoeuvre in comparison to last time. There we are, that's it, sphenoid ostium. Yep. Although there's still a bit of mucosa there, that seems to have... ...cleaved away from the other bit. There we are. Sphenoid ostium. So that's what one should be able to see, sphenoid ostium very clearly with the mucosa properly removed. And then we should be able to very much more easily disarticulate cartilaginous. And the bony septum. And then we come the other side. And there's the other sphenoid ostium, yeah? Just there. Sphenoid ostium that side, and sphenoid ostium that side. And then, all this mucosa should be pushed down. Don't want to tempt fate, but it seems to be behaving better than last time. There we are. Right, Petite Chirongeres, please big. Thank you, so... Thank you, so... There we are. There we are. Thank you, so... Right, drill please. I'm going to use a drill early on here, because... ...the more bone I can remove. There's the sphenoid ostium. There, so... Come from there... ...all the way down. Just give you a little bit of wash. Yeah. Because it's getting hot. Yeah. And I'll put this up down there, yep. Yep. Grab a sucker with me, thank you. Just a little bit of wash. There we are. And I'll put this up down there, yep. Yeah. Grab a sucker with me, thank you, so... A true car for that. Thank you. Good, and then drill down there. And that ostium there. There we are, longitudinales, please large longitudinales. There we are, longitudinales, please large longitudinales. Thank you. That's one. There we are, good. And a quick irrigation down there, let's try that one. Good. Good. Back biter, please. So... Should be able to get you in now, around the back there. And then the big sucker there, Murat, please. Wrong shears, you've got the wrong shears there, thank you, yep. Thank you. There we are. Good. And then the debrider, please. Let's see what we can do here. That's blocking up now, isn't it? OK, big irrigation, and the big sucker's there, is it? Thank you. So... Thank you, wrong shears, please. Thank you. OK, so... There we are. So, there's our middle ironing. Always keep an eye on the middle ironing. Kerosene three, please, or four. Thank you, well done. So... Well, one. Thank you. Two. Thank you. Rest up here. Bite and go in. Bite and go in. So that's what you do in your patient, bite and then... Because otherwise you just get a bit of mucosa that strips off your... Septum there, or tissue, and just goes straight into your... Your view, the end of the scope, getting... Mucky. There we are, one. Two. There we are. Like that, see? It just strips away, so you've got to bite in... Bite on and push in, first of all. There we are, good, so... And now into the sphenoid sinus. Sphenoid sinus. We're, again, just a little bit high. And I can't see the floor properly. So until I can see the floor properly, I don't want to go too... Much further into the... Sphenoid sinus. So... Give me another little bit of drilling... On that floor. Push the mucosa down, and there we are. Septum there again, yeah. Give me a little bit of radiation, please. Give me a little bit of radiation, please. There we are. There we are, yeah, yeah. Lovely. Big irrigation down my side, thanks. I'll grab that circle of me. There we are. Thank you. There. Looking like fossa, but again, still just need... That little bit lower. If you're ever in doubt, you've got to see the sphenoid sinus floor. Just got to see it. You're really confident... Where it's gone. All that bone in your way. Once this has been removed... Yeah, a bit of radiation, please. Good. Good, big irrigation there, thank you. Right, floor there. OK, so... Once one's categorically seen floor, big rangers... You know all is good. Clean it out, and then we're going to come down here. Get rid of this mucosa within the sphenoid sinus. And there we are. Floor and fossa. All nice and easy. With my ranger, I've actually managed to bite that mucosa that's in the clibal rhesus... So that I know that I can get to the bottom of the fossa. And that means that I can therefore get in every single... Look and carry... Cranny for the tumour. And there we are. So... Sucker, please. OK, carotid prominence. That's what I thought was a fracture, but it's not. There's another carotid prominence. And I can get my sucker from one side to the other, and I can get it top to bottom. And I've left that mucosa alone. And here's our fossa. And there's the floor, right at the bottom. So without a shadow of a doubt, we've got all our anatomical landmarks. So... We then need to... Drill over the carotid prominences a little bit. From side to side. Although... We know that we can't actually... Expose the cavernous sinuses. We can't get much of a floor there. The secret here is to... Actually drill away as much of the... Bone, because then it's... It's not as easy to get the bone out. Bone, because then it's... Easy to take the carotid. So I like to drill the whole lot. Sometimes you can actually create a little... Trap door. So... Yeah. Yeah, thank you, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A bit down my side, thank you. Lovely. Some irrigation? Yeah, thank you. Good. Thank you. Thank you. Longeres, please. Give her that carotid. Good. And... And cap. Irrigation, thank you. Thank you. More irrigation? Bigwig square, that's fine. Yeah, bigwig, yeah. And cap. And... And... And... And... And... Good, so a kerosene three, please? Or two, let's try two. And supplement, thank you. And cap. Thank you. Up to the edge. Lovely, let's have the... Second line, please. Yes. Knife, will you give that over there in a second? Thank you. So now... That's... That's quite soft. That's much... Very different to the last one. There we are. Lovely. Back to you. And I'd like to dissect the one we just had, thanks. Thank you. So come around the capsule. Tune up. Lovely, rongeurs, please. And... And... And... And... And... And... And... Thank you. Lovely, I have the 45 ring. Thank you. Lovely, rongeurs again. Thanks. And... And... And... And... And... Rongeurs, please. And cap. Sucker, please. And cap. Curette, please, that ring curette. Thank you. Thank you. Er... rongeurs again? Have you got any smaller rongeurs? Yeah, I've got one spot in front. Thank you. And cap. Thank you. Sucker, please. Thank you. Curette again, please. The ring? The ring, thanks. There we are. Big rongeurs. Yes, nice one to do. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And the big sucker already. There we are. I think she might be OK. There we are. Done. Right, she's right.
