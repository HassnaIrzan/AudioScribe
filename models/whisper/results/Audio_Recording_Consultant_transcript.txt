 So we insert our endoscope through the right nostril and we recognize the structures here, the inferior turbinate, the middle turbinate and that's the superior one, the floor. So yeah, we go behind the middle turbinate, actually we can lateralize it, so we get space. I haven't done that many times so it's also for training for me. The texture is nice. So we're breaking it. As much as possible. We've got a coenor inferior here, it's our landmark. Yeah, you can see here. So we know we're lateralizing the middle turbinate nicely. Yeah, I think it's broke. So we can see here the ostium, right? Yeah. Do you agree? That looks like the sphenoid ostium to me. Huh? That looks like the ostium, yeah. Just to see that we're in the right space. I don't know, does it lateralize more? You can lateralize the turbinate as much as you need to, yeah, it lateralizes quite well. I don't want to break it. Yeah. Anatomically that fits really good, doesn't it? So if you go down, follow up from the coenor, that looks like it. Uh-huh. Yeah. So I guess now we've got, we've lateralized the turbinate to get a good view. Can you see it in a second? Yeah. It's almost out of the way. Yeah. You seeing? Yeah. So this one going back. It's falling back a little. You may need to fracture it to lateralize it properly. I'm trying. That looks nice. That's nice. Yeah, okay. Yeah, now we're better for sure. So, here we are. Are we making a flap? We can create a rescue flap. Rescue flap? Yeah. Is it possible? It's possible. So we can use the knife. It's coming back into view a little, hasn't it? Yeah. So I think if you can get the scope in there, it will hold the turbinate up for you. Huh? If you can get the scope a little lower, the scope will hold the turbinate out of your way. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So... Let's say that we're cutting. It will cut this new corset, so this knife should cut through the new corset and you can create a flap. So we should avoid the upper part to not cause any problems with the olfaction. And... Let's see. Okay. Sorry, now it's not optimal, but... Let's say that we have a flap. Now, I will use a frayer to release it from the septum and push it downwards. So this is where it's quite tough. See if there's just that little connection. Hmm. There we go. Yeah. There we go, right. Okay. Okay. Okay, I'm going back. It's just not quite cut down there, is it? Yeah. Should I use the knife again? Yeah, I think you might need to free it up at a depth with the knife to be able to retract it. Okay. I think that's about it. Yeah, now it's just the... Yeah. Now it's just the... Yeah. ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... ...the... Now it's just the... Sorry, I destroyed it. You stripped the holes out. You might as well have been... Yeah. Did you leave anything now? Oh, I destroyed... No, I'm telling you, there's an anterior fracture there. Okay, so you... So, let's say... I mean, you've got a big flap. Yeah, and I've got a big flap, but we shouldn't take it at all. I think you should... We should go half the way. Let's see our entry point again. Yeah. Ah. Sorry. Well... Here we are. So that's... You've got it on one side. And then we can see this after as well. Yeah. And, uh, to go from the other... ...side to prepare things. So you can either... Or, uh, go from this side. Yeah. You can go from this side and fracture across, or we can go from the other side and prepare. Yeah. So, um... Up cut or... ...drill a bit more, huh? It's up to you. I mean, you might want to see the other side before you drill. Okay. Fracture the posterior septum across so you can see. Yeah. So... Nice. Then strip the other side. Perfect. So... We do the posterior septostomy. We break... We detach the... ...the flap from the other side. And we identify... And we identify the vomer in the... ...lower end of it. Mm-hmm. I think... ...it should be like this area. Okay. Sorry, no, it's terrible, eh? It's like you're struggling with your flap coming up, aren't you? Yeah. And you may push that mucosal flap down. Mm-hmm. Nice. Okay. So... So... So... Let's take... ...the... ...tutoring... ...Williams... ...and perform a... ...removal of... ...the posterior part of the septum. Okay. You agree? I think that, yeah, I think... ...get this out of your way, and then you can go across... ...see both sides. Nice. I wonder if you can... Yeah, there it is. ...this man's nose... ...and... ...the... ...flap. Okay. Continue with that process... ...of the septostomy... ...to identify the... ...the postume on the other side as well. So maybe I can... ...make some more space now... ...to see what we have. So now you're just stripping the contralateral mucosa? Yeah. Stripping the mucosa on the other side, then I can see the... ...postume on the left side, just... ...just... ...looking at that now. Here it is. It's a bit hard. Yeah, the mucosa is quite soft. Yeah. I should clean up the pieces... ...later on, so we can see that now. Pulling laterally... ...the... ...mucosa of the left side. How can I deal with that? I think... ...there's a lot of mucosa falling in there. Yeah. We need to take some of that mucosa out. Yeah. Excuse me, the debrider. Yeah, you can give that a go. So if you just touch on the screen... ...to switch the drip... ...from the drip to the debrider. Yeah, just touch that. Yeah, that's fine. Just turn the suction on. So we're going back for the debrider. What's the button here? So that... ...that allows you to rotate it. And then you can see that's the opening there. So you can point the opening whichever way you want. So that's off? Yeah. So let's see where we are again. We're inserting the debrider. Is it open now? So you've got to press the pedal. Yeah, right. Forgot that. Ah, nice. It starts munching it up. Okay, so... ...we're removing some of the extra mucosa... ...that won't be of any use. To have some better... ...view. I think you might also be stripping the tub... ...of mucosa. Yeah. I should go deeper. Yeah, I think you should go deeper. Yeah, I think you should go deeper. Okay. Maybe I should pull... ...take some of... ...the mucosa with... ...Williams. Yeah, I mean the mucosa is tough. It's quite hard to get it to come. And you're flat because the way you're flat and tall... ...you've got a very large... It's if you can mobilise it inferiorly... ...so it stays out of your way. And then... And then maybe... ...once you've got a bit of a view... ...just re-establishing where the anatomy is. Yeah. Maybe... ...should we stop it? I don't know. The suction. Yeah. Just turn it off. Yeah. Okay, it distracts me. So let's go back... ...to see where we are again. So that's... ...the inferior, the middle. And we were working in here. Here's the right ostium. And from the other side... ...is the left. Yeah. Yeah, accidentally I took some of the mucosa... ...of the turbinate instead of... ...what I was aiming to. I don't know how much we can... ...detach further. You think we can do more further? It should strip. It should strip with the fria. Yeah. It's a bit... ...it's a bit... ...it's a bit... ...it's a bit... ...it's a bit... ...it's a bit... ...it's a bit... I think... ...continue to strip until you're happy with your view. And again, if you need to... ...to mobilise or take out some of the mucosa... ...to be happy with your view then. Yeah. Yeah, so it might be that... ...I need to take a bit of mucosa out there maybe too. There's that posterior... ...that lip of the posterior side... ...of the sternum. Yeah. There's that... ...that lip of the posterior sectum as well. It's holding you back, isn't it? Down near the bone. Here? That bone lip is kind of... This part you mean? Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah, I don't think I can... ...move it more than that. That is a mess. That's OK. I mean, you can get it and you can't... Yeah. OK, I'll take a... ...a gandibride there. Where's the suction? It's right... ...there. And I'm trying now to... ...remove some part of the... ...mucosa that is over the... ...left ostium... ...to get some better view. OK. I think we're getting there. It's better now. Just pushing... ...the rest of the mucosa down. OK. So... Let's clean our endoscope and... ...see what we have. I think that's it. Let's go again. So... ...right... Mm-hm. So now we have both sides... ...and we need to drill... ...and remove... ...more of the septum... ...and go down to the vomer... ...and make some more space. Should we drill? I think we can, can't we? We can drill... ...down to get to the vomer. Yeah. Because I think otherwise we're just always going to be pushed... ...superiorly. And that way we can get this out of our way. OK. Now... Can I cut it a bit? Yeah. I'm going to cut that. Thank you. So... Let's see again. OK. OK. We have space to drill. And you can use the suction from the other side. Or... yeah. So we're drilling... ...septum... ...and going to the vomer. OK. We need to get... ...into the sphenoid sinus... ...by connecting... ...the two openings. So now we can see mucosa from the... ...inner part of the sphenoid. We're getting into the cavity. And we... ...drill... ...more to the... ...er... ...yeah. We drill more in the area of the vomer as well. I guess what you want is to make sure that you can get down to the vomer... ...see it properly... ...and get your instants into the sinus at the right angle. So we can cross that now. So far so good. You push it down with the... ...suction? Yeah. Sorry I'm... I'm gonna... ...move the mucosa out of the way again. And break that part of the... ...septum. That should go anyway. Yeah, you agree? Yeah. Okay. Alright. So... ...we can see... ...the vomer down there, eh? Is it? Sorry. I'm struggling with the... ...mucosa. I don't know how I managed to do that. Okay. Okay. Let's drill a bit more. Thank you. Oh no. We're dying. Come up on the spot. Yeah, that's nice. That's nice. So that's the... ...that's your turbinate you're hitting there, isn't it? Mm-hmm. I think you're just hitting the turbinate there with the scalp. Yeah, so there... ...there's your turbinate. Yeah. It might be that you need to remove some of that mucosa if it's constantly getting in your way. Yeah. So let's remove some of the mucosa. Okay. Just be careful because I think that's the turbinate there you've got. Careful you don't bite the turbinate. Okay. Okay. We have some better view. Okay. Let's see what we can see here. Yeah, that's... ...the bomber. Yeah, I think it is. I think that's the view we wanted, the septum was just holding us back. Sorry? I think that's a nicer view, the septum was just holding us back a little, wasn't it? Yeah. Okay. So we need to drill down the septation of the sphenoid sinus after getting also the mucosa out. Yeah. So... I'm removing the mucosa of the sphenoid sinus. Okay. Sorry. Okay. And I'm also taking part of the septations as well because they're very thin. Let's see. Got some washing. Let's... yeah. Ah, we have a wash, okay. I mean... Relax. Some washing and... I'll clean the... ...the endoscopy a bit. So... Let's go back to see what we've done. Ah, we have still things to do. We have... ...to treat the erontias. Removing... ...the... ...mucosa. Clearing up... ...the sinus. Okay. I have to clean the microscope... ...the endoscopy. Mm-hmm. So we've got that. I think I should have drilled a bit more, right? I drilled a bit more. Down. Of the sphenoid sinus. So it's the thing to see the salar and the anatomy. No, we need to extend it a bit more. We need to drill a bit more here. Okay. We're drilling down the vomer. Okay. Yeah, now we're... ...able to see a bit more. And... ...open the whole... ...area in the sphenoid sinus. Okay, let's clean a bit more. Let's give you some more from that drill. Okay. I'm still not sure we've got a great view halfway up there. Okay. Mm-hmm. So that looks like you're stripping the mucosa down in the clinoid and recessed there, aren't you? That looks good. Now we need to clean that up a bit. So I think that's the cellar. And... ...we'll touch all of it all around. Okay. So we need to identify the carotid pillars... Mm-hmm. ...so not to make any damage. So this would be the one side here where I'm avoiding. And the other side... Well, you've still got a little mucosa on it, hasn't it? I have mucosa there. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. That was... ...a good move, I think. There we go. That looks like... So... Yeah, under the mucosa, finally. Mm-hmm. Do you think I drilled more than I needed here, or...? If you go in with your scope, that's much nicer. Yeah, okay. So... Perfect. That's... That's the view we were looking for, I think. Yeah. So we can see... ...the right carotid. Yeah. The left. And... And... That's the pituitary fossa, the anterior part. That's some... Some of the... ...mucosa that I didn't remove. The optic nerve should be up here. Eh? Do you agree? I think so, yeah. I think that's the mucosa in the... It needs to go. ...planoid fossa. I think if that's stretched, you'll get a really nice view of the cellar. Sorry. Let's go back. I destroyed this people's nose. Okay. We're getting there. We could also use the debrider, I guess. Yeah, it might work. Yeah, it might work. Or... ...with carrying with that, what do you think? Can you get down? Come again? What? Are you getting the angle you need to get into it? I lost my orientation now. Yes, I think. I'll enjoy that a bit. Here we are again. Still removing the mucosa. Here we are. We can start drilling. Eh? Yeah, if you're comfortable, you can see what you need to see. We can start drilling and... ...see what happens. So that's a septation in the sphenoid sinus. And we'll drill it down. To make an opening, identify the dura and... ...get access... ...make more space than with an abcut. I think we got something. That's a dura. I think that's a dura, yeah. Let's thin the anterior part of... ...the cella. Let's take the eye canals. And we'll do the... ...the cella. Let's take the eye cancer and abcut free. We'd normally use... ...a smaller one. Sorry. Okay. So you're now widening your cella opening. Yeah, we're... ...making the opening... ...to the cella wider with the abcut. If I manage to... So because we only have the one eye... ...sometimes it's helpful to go backhanding with it to cut down. Yeah. So we're going to widen the cella. It's helpful to go backhanding with it to cut down. I'll drill it more. We're going... ...to the cavernous sinus. On both sides. And trying to... ...to make it... ...to the... ...to the... ...to the... ...to the... ...to the... ...to the... ...to the... ...to the... ...to the sides. And trying to avoid the... ...of course the carotid. Oops. I think I'm going to do that now. Careful you don't give the pituitary a bash. The dura might just be open now. Eh? I think the dura might just be open now. Oh. In that bottom corner. Open the dura. I'll show you... ...there look. I think it's there. Hm? See that little hole? Yeah there's a... ...an opening in the dura. Let's finish. Where am I? I lost my... ...I can do that like that. I think you've got quite a nice... ...you've got a nice view though haven't you of Girona? Hm? You've got quite a nice view of Girona. Yeah. I do. So we were... ...we were... ...we were driving... ...we were driving... ...we were driving... ...we were driving... ...we were driving... But I do. So we were... ...so we were... ...just to make some more space if I managed... ...just to make some more space if I managed... Maybe if you come out with your scope and follow the instrument in. There you go. Okay I got stuck somewhere. Just getting stuck on the turbine I think. So we need to decompress the nerves as well. What type of tumor is that? So it's like a macro-army normal. A macro-army normal. So we need to debulk it and... ...release the pressure from the optic nerves. So let's make a better... ...wide air opening. And if we open the optic nerve... ...and if we open the optic nerve... ...then we achieve more in the knee. Okay. So let's open the dura, that's what you're suggesting. It's time. You've got a nice opening. Alright. So we cruciate the opening... ...of the dura. It's quite tall. Okay. Hmm. Not good. We can see the tumor underneath. So... ...we need to open the dura... ...very well and avoid any... ...leaks. And get to the tumor and debulk it. Let's say that the dura... ...makes a folding and it's open like that. Yeah, it has a memory. And let's use... ...the... ...curate. 45 degree linkurate. 45 degree curate. Okay. Come out with the scope. Maybe I'm following the instrument down. There we go. Hmm. Looks like a marmalade. Very nice. Let's take that sample. Okay. Yep. Send that... ...smear. Let's... ...debulk as much as possible. Okay. Maybe we can stop the... Stop the suction? Yeah. It's very noisy. Ah. Perfect. So... ...so we remove parts of the tumor. We can also use... ...use a suction. Nice. So here... ...go away. We might be able to identify the... ...tweeter stalk. Let's say. And... ...we can... ...we can... Huh? There's something there. Oh there is? Okay. Should I remove the dura totally? To see inside? The dura is quite thick. And it... ...it isn't folding back. So you might have to remove it. So let's take the debrider again. It doesn't need to be connected. It's fine. It's fine. Obviously you wouldn't normally take a debrider to a dura. Yeah, normally no. Should we do something different? No, no, no. Just to see what we have in there. Because the dura is very thick. But we can omit this step... ...in the official recording. I should give you a view now I think. That's enough, right? I think so. I think you can get your curator and sweep. Okay. Let's take the curator again. And... ...let's see. I think it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Okay. Let's take the curator again. So you have to take that outside. Hmm? We remove the rest of the tumor. We'll send samples. Yeah, I think so. Do you think we decompressed the top? I think we decompressed it. It looks like there's still a little bit of tumor through there. There is upwards and to the right. Come on, go away. That tumor. Okay, very good. We remove most of it. That's when you are happy with your reception. People who watch will get vertigo from my movements, I know. I'm not sure if it's the same for you. I'm not sure if it's the same for you. I'm not sure if it's the same for you. I'm not sure if it's the same for you. You see? Yeah. Let's see all the way around. Okay, there's something there as well. You can take that piece here. Hello. Little tumor. Nice. Okay, I think it's gone. Did you get it? If you're happy, we can finish. That's the stalk. That's the stalk. Yeah, and the pituitary. And the pituitary. Okay, there is a piece here, but... I don't think I can manage to take that away. I don't think I can manage to take that away. The top. Okay, I took the last piece. That was the last piece. End of story. Okay, great. We're finished. Are we doing the repair? I think maybe we should get going.
